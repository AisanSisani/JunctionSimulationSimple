# JunctionSimulationSimple

### Overview
This project is an example application of High Level Architecture. 
Runtime Infrastructure was generated by OpenRTI Libraries. 
RaCon Library - which includes .NET wrapper classes over the Native RTIs - was used to code in higher level of abstraction. 
Simge Software was used to create the FDD and FED files needed.


### How To Run:
- Open the solution (JunctionSimulationSimple.sln) in Visual Studio
- Add the OpenRTI References
- Change the FDD and FED paths in the SimulationManager.cs files
- Build the solution in Debug mode
- Run instances of the projects
